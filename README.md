NBA Game Predictor

How To Run
- Run model.py and click on the link produced in the terminal (locally-hosted webpage)
- The resulting webpage will give predictions for each matchup happening that night

Disclaimers
- The trained models are from early December, so retrain the models with new data if wanting more accurate results.
- New data can be gathered using the Jupyter Notebooks under data_pipeline
- Models only factor in game statistics from 2022-23 season till the current season (early December)
